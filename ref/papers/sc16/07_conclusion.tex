\section{Future Work} %-------------------------------------------------------%
%
\textbf{Development}: Continue refining and expanding the core SOSflow
libraries and the SOS workflow performance model.
\\
\textbf{Optimization}: Optimize the SOSflow codes for memory use
and data latency. Add mechanisms for throttling of data flow to
increase reliability in resource-constrained cases. Map out 
best-fit metrics for dedicating in situ resources to a monitoring
platform for the major extant and proposed compute clusters, and build this
intelligence into the SOSflow implementation.
\\
\textbf{Integration}: Explore options for deployment and integration with
existing HPC monitoring and analytics codes at LLNL and other
national laboratories.

\section{Conclusion}
%
SOSflow provides a flexible research platform for investigating the
properties of existing and future scientific workflows, supporting
both current and future scales of execution.
%
Experimental results demonstrated that SOSflow is capable of
observation, introspection, feedback and control of complex scientific
workflows, and that it has desirable scaling properties.
